# Ultimate Project Builder Sparrow Project
This is my documentation for Ultimate Project Builder Sparrow Project

# About

This is the documentation for Tableau Visualization published on Tableau Public. I recieved a csv and imported it into SQL and Excel in order to better feel, understand, and modify the data. The goal for the UPB was to create a project that would specifically address a company that posted a job listings need in order to highlight aptitude for the role. 
The company we referred to is called Sparrow which focused on being the go to Credit Card for the non-prime market.

# Explanation
All of the graphs allow the user to filter the rest of the dashboard by the attribute. This helps achieve the results of finding their niche and locating specifically underrepresented groups for Credit Cards. My decision to include a card to the Dashboard was if it related to three major things
1. Total Transaction Counts - One of the major ways Credit Card comapnies generate their income is through Transaction fees paid by buisnesses meaning the more individual transactions implies an increase to profits.
2. Interst charges - Another major way Credit card companies gneerate income is through interest charges on revolving balances or cash advances.
3. Demographics - Because Sparrow specifically wants to focus on the non-prime market identifying who they have already is crucial.

## Dashboard

### Total Customers

This card was created in order to allow the user to undertsand how much of the customer base fits into the selected filters.

### Attrited Customers

This card allows us to see which customers have been lost in relation to the continued customers.

### Total Revolving Balance

This card allows us to see the Total revolving balances of the specific subgroup that we are looking at.

### Total Transaction Count

This card allows us to see the Total transaction count  of the specific subgroup that we are looking at.

### Income Category vs Avg. Utiltization Ratio and Total Transaction Count

This card allows us to see and filter the Income Category. The two graphs are compared against the Average Utitlization Ratio and the Trotal Transaction Count. This is important since it allows us to identify the Income Category and potential debt the customers can maintain.

### Total Revolving Balance vs Card Category

This card allows us to investigate if the Total Revolving Balance changes based on the Card category.

### Transaction Count vs Card Category

This card allows us to investigate if the Total Transaction count changes based on the Card category.

### Gender, Age, and Education

These card allow us to see the specific demographics of the Customers for the Dashboard.

# Improvements

If I were to redo this project I would make some modifications:
- Change how I did the formatting of the Dashboard with being more meticulous about how I put the containers for the Layout.
- Change the Attrited Customers so that the Attrited Customers portion of the horizontal bar graph would come first.
- Modify the alighnment for the top row.
- Spend more time on UX design (i.e. Different Colors, Borders between cards, using Company related colors)
- Include more Data Transformations and Aggregations in SQL while I don't think this project particularly warranted it I would like to practice the skill.
